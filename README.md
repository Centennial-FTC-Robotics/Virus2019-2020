## FTC TEAM 9866

This is the repository containing the project for VIRUS 9866's 2019-2020 season!

## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control VIRUS' *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition robot.  To use this SDK, consult with Matthew about stealing the code, or just go ahead and take it dude, it's public.

### User Documentation and Tutorials
*FIRST* maintains online documentation with information and tutorials on how to use the *FIRST* Tech Challenge software and robot control system, but who has time for that! Just straight up download the apps online and plug the phones in. For more information about all that stuff about syncing REV hubs, I'm lost there too man.

### Javadoc Reference Material
The Javadoc reference documentation for the FTC SDK is now available online, and they're fairly useful, but infinitely more useful is the hover feature on android studio. It tells you a lot more quickly and isn't a pain to read.

### Questions?
For technical questions regarding our robot, send us an email! ftc9866@gmail.com!
